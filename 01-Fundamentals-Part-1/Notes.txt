              JavaScript Fundamentals


Variables and Values -------------------------------

  - a variable is like a box. the variable is the box and the value is whatever is inside of it. 
  For example:

  let firstName = 'Jordan';

  - firstName is the variable (box) and the value is 'Jordan' (what is inside the box)

  This allows the variable to be called multiple times without hard coding in the values and allows for dynamic programming.

  - camelCase is also a common practice to enter in multiple word variables. The first letter should start with a lower case and the next word should start with a capital - no spaces between. They should also never start with a capital letter when considering variables. Make variable names meaningful. 

  For example: 

  let name = 'Jordan'; (This is a bad practice. Name is not descriptive enough. )

  let firstName; (This is a better practice. the variable name is descriptive and it follows camelCase. The naming allows you to know what the variable is without looking at the value of it.)


Objects and Primitives -------------------------------

  In JavaScript, every value is either an Object or a primitive value. If a value is not an object, it is a primitive.

  Object Example: 

  let person = {
    firstName: 'Jordan',
    age: 23,
    job: 'manager'
  };

  Primitive Value Example:

  let firstName = 'Jordan';
  let age = 23;

  There are 7 different primitive data types:

  1. number

    - Are always floating point numbers meaning they will always have a decimal. used for decimals and integers. 

    Example below:

    let age = 25;

  2. string

    - Are a sequence of characters that is used for text. Must always be wrapped in either single or double quotes.

    Example below:

    let firstName = 'Jordan';

  3. boolean

    - A logical type that can only be true or false. Used for making decisions.

    Example below: 

    let isHungry = false;
    let isHotOutside = true;

  4. undefined

    - Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined (empty value);

    Example below:

    let lastName;

  5. null

    - Also means empty value, but Typically when a variable's value is return empty.

  6. symbol

    - Value that is unique and cannot be changed.

  7. big int

    - larger integers than the Number type can hold

  JavaScript has dynamic typing. The data type does not  have to be defined when a variable is declared - it is done automatically. 

    Example below:

    let JavaScriptIsFun = true (current data type is boolean)

    JavaScriptIsFun = 'YES'; (new data type is a string)


  The variable does not have a type, the value within the variable is what has the type.

  - Typeof is an operator that will tell you the data type of the value. 

    Example below:  

    typeof('jordan') will return string.
    typeof(true) will return boolean.
    typeof(23) will return number.

Comments----------------------------------------------

  use // to comment out single lines of code.

  use /* */ to comment out multiple lines of code. anything betweem the astricks will be commented out. in JavaScript.


Declaring Variables ----------------------------------

  var is the old way of declaring variables and is not really recommended anymore.

  let keyword allows for variables to change later.

  const stands for 'Constant' is another way to declare variables but they cannot be changed later.. Const variables cannot be declared undefined.

  const should be used by default unless you are positive that the variable will change in the future.

  Example: 

  let age = 30;
  const birthYear = 1996;

  the age will change, so let is appropriate, while the birthyear will always remain the same so it can be a const.


Basic Operators---------------------------------------

  Operations can be performed on a variable declaration. 

  Example below

    const ageJordan = 2026 - 1996; (this will return 30).

    Math Operators ----------------------------------

    += is used when you want to add a value onto the current value of a variable. Must be used with X unless declaring a value to a new variable. 

    Example below:

    let x = 10;
    x += 10; (This will print 20).

    The same examples can be used with -=, *=, and /= as well.

    x++ is another operator that will increment that value by 1. 

    x-- is the same, just decrementing by 1.

    Examples below:

    let x = 1;

    x++; (Value is now 2)
    x--; (Value is now 1)
    
    Comparison Operators -----------------------------


    This example will return a true or false based on the conditions. The result will have to be either logged to the console or stored in a variable (in this case 'isOlder').

    let isOlder = ageJordan > ageSamantha; (false);
    
    Other comparison operators are >, <, >=, <=

  Strings-------------------------------

  when making a string with an apostrophy in a word, the entire string must be wrapped in double quotes.

  Example:

  let example = "Here's an example" (Here's means that the entire string needs to be wrapped in double quotes)

  Template Literals are ways to make a string without have to concate multiple strings together while being able to type the string and places the variables within the string.

  Example:

    let firstName = 'Jordan';
    `Hello, my name is ${firstName}`;

    Output: "Hello, my name is Jordan"


Type Conversion and Type Coercion---------------------------

Type Conversion is when the type is explicitly converted from one type to another. We can use the Number() function that will allow a number in string data type to be converted to a number data type. 

When converting a value that cannot be converted, it will result in NaN. JavaScript can only convert into 3 types; String, Number, and Boolean.

Example: 

let yearInput = '1991'; 
(This will be a string data type when printed on console);

let yearInput = Number('1991');
(This will be a number data type when printed on the console.)

let yearInput = Number('Jordan');
(This will result in NaN value);

let yearInput = String(23);
(This will result in 23 being a string -> '23');



Type Coercion is when the type is converted by the compiler automatically and not explicitly.

Whenever a number is coerced with a string, it will be changed to a string by the compiler.

Example: 

console.log("I'm " + 23 + ' years old');
This will result in the number 23, being a string instead of a number, even if it was entered as a number.


console.log('23' - '10' - 3); -> 10
This will result in 10 as a number data type. The Strings will be converted to numbers because of using subtraction. 

If we take the same scenario and added them together instead, it would result in 23103 because the compiler would concate all the strings together and convert the 3 into a string data type prior to adding them together.

The above would also happen if we used multiplication or division of the strings. 

let n = '1' + 1; -> will make a string of '11'
let n = n - 1; -> converts the string '11' to 11 and subtracts 1
result = 10;


Truthy and Falsey Values -----------------------------------------

 In JavaScript, there are 5 falsey values. (0, '', undefined, null, NaN). These values will be false when converted to a boolean. Everything else will be considered a truthy value.

 An empty object is returned as a truthy value.

Equality Operators -----------------------------------------------

  Strict Equality Operator is ===. This type of operator DOES NOT perform type coercion when comparing the two values.

  Example:

  if (18 === '18') -> This will return false

  Loose Equality Operator is ==. This type of operator WILL perform type coercion when comparing the two values. 

  Example: 

  if (18 == '18') -> This will return true.
